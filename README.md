# CURRENCY CONVERTER APPLICATION

## Goals 
- Create a `mini` currency conversion calculator using real-time data<br>
- Assess learnt programming skills so far (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)<br>
- Identify my Strong and Weak areas within the coding context<br>
- Comply with the Moringa School's academic requirements 

## Project Description 
For this project, I am required to develop an online web app where users can check real-time currency conversion rates using different currencies. I will be using the fetch function to source data from a `public` API server. This is a single-page project. 
## Project Set-Up
### Prerequisites
* node v14.17.4 and above, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
### Deliverables 
There are `three` key deliverables namely MVPs, API Server, and User Features as described below: 
#### MVP (Most Viable Product)
Input field from which the amount and currency is being converted<br> 
Input field to which the amount and currency is being converted<br>
Calculate button for executing the conversion process 
Swap button

#### API Server 

#### User Features
Users should be able to:<br>
Input the amount they want to be converted<br>
See the converted amount in selected currency of interest<br>
Clear the data/Reset the converter to default 

```
