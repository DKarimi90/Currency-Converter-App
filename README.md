# CURRENCY CONVERTER WEB APPLICATION

## Goals 
- Create a `mini` currency conversion calculator using real-time data<br>
- Assess learnt programming skills so far (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)<br>
- Identify my Strong and Weak areas within the coding context<br>
- Comply with the Moringa School's academic requirements 

## Project Description 
For this project, I am required to develop an online web app where users can check real-time currency conversion rates using different denominations. I will be using the inbuilt fetch function to source data from a `public` API server. This is a single-page project and it is a requirement to integrate at least three event listeners. In my case, I will include the `click`, `input`, and `change` event listeners. 
## Project Set-Up
### Prerequisites
* node v14.17.4 and above, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
### Deliverables 
There are `three` key deliverables namely MVPs, API Server, and User Features as described below: 
#### MVP (Most Viable Product)
The app includes an input field from which the amount and currency is being converted. There is also an input field to which the amount and currency is being converted. A Switch button to help interchange the first and second currency. I have included a `calculate` function within the `.js` file to execute computations in the background and display converted figures as expected. Input is only in `numbers` as opposed to `string`. There is also a `dummy` user authentication login form. 

#### API Server 
Public API url is retrieved from `https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/8d089b379c00953bf716e84a/latest/USD`

#### User Features
For this web app, users should be able to:<br>
Input, either in float or integer values, the desired amount to be converted<br>
Change currency from `160` denominations<br>
Check real-time currency conversion rates from any currency of interest within the above mentioned 160 denominations<br>
View the output figure from their input currency amount  

```
