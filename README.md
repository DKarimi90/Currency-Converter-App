# CURRENCY CONVERTER WEB APPLICATION

## Goals 
- Create a `mini` currency conversion calculator using real-time data<br>
- Assess learnt programming skills so far (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)<br>
- Identify my Strong and Weak areas within the coding context<br>
- Comply with the Moringa School's academic requirements 

## Project Description 
For this project, I am developing a currency-converter app with Kenyan currency as the base denomination. I will be using the inbuilt fetch function to source data from a `public` API server. This is a single-page project and it is a requirement to integrate at least three event listeners. In my case, I will include the `click`, `input`, and `submit` event listeners. 
## Project Set-Up
### Prerequisites
* node v14.17.4 and above, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
### Deliverables 
There are `three` key deliverables namely MVPs, API Server, and User Features as described below: 
#### MVP (Most Viable Product)
The app includes an input field from which a user can select/input amount in Kenyan Shillings. There is also an input field where users can select their desired currency of conversion. Another input field is the user authentication that requires a `username` and `password` for service access. I have included a `calculate` function within the `.js` file to execute computations in the background and display converted figures as expected. Input is only in `numbers` as opposed to `string`. There is also a `dummy` user authentication login form. 

#### API Server 
Public API url is retrieved from the `Rapidapi` website: `https://exchangerate-api.p.rapidapi.com/rapid/latest/KES`

#### User Features
For this web app, users should be able to:<br>
Input, either in float or integer values, amount within the first field in Kenyan shillings<br>
Automatically compute different amounts of kenyan currency relative to other `160` denominations<br>
Check real-time currency conversion rates from any currency of interest within the above mentioned 160 denominations<br>


```
